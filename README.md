# findreplace
Python script to find &amp; replace specified strings inside a given directory of files.

Unstable. Tkinter GUI is rudimentary.

Minimal testing has been performed, though the current operations have been successfully performed in a production environment. The format has been altered since and placed into individual functions. The individual functions were once each separate python scripts; this script combines each script into one and allows for user input.
